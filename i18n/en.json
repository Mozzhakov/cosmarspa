      "story": "My name is Alona — I’m a licensed esthetician, laser specialist, and the founder of CosmarSpa Med Beauty. What I offer is not just aesthetics. It’s where science meets sensitivity, and where personalized attention meets professional care.\n\nMy journey began in medicine — in critical care, working with patients in the most fragile states. Over time, I expanded my knowledge in skincare, laser and device-based techniques, and developed a strong foundation in facial anatomy, aging processes, and aesthetic methods — including injectable approaches gained through international training.",
      "philosophy": "Today, I bring together everything that truly matters in skin health and self-confidence:\n• a medical approach without overwhelming terminology;\n• personalized protocols based on your skin and your goals;\n• modern laser, device-based, and hands-on skincare treatments;\n• and above all — sincere care and full attention to every woman who walks through my door.\n\nAt CosmarSpa Med Beauty, you’re not just receiving a service — you’re stepping into a space where you are heard, understood, and treated with professionalism and respect.\n\nI believe beauty begins with the inner decision to be yourself. And I’m here to make that journey inspiring."
